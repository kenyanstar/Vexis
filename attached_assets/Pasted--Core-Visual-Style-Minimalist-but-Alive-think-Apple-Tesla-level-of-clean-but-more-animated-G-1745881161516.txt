✨ Core Visual Style
Minimalist but Alive — think Apple + Tesla level of clean, but more animated.

Glassmorphism (blurred, translucent backgrounds).

Dark Mode default, but light mode is elegant, not boring.

Neon accent colors (customizable): soft glows of blue, pink, purple, green.

Smooth micro-animations — buttons ripple softly when clicked, tabs open with slight "spring" movement.

Fonts: use futuristic but readable fonts like Inter, Satoshi, or even a custom Nova typeface.

🖥 Page/Screen Concepts:
🏠 Home/New Tab Page

Top: Large clock & weather widget (sleek, semi-transparent).
Center: AI "command bar" to type anything — site search, web search, action shortcuts.
Bottom: Smart "Launchpads" — auto-arranging your favorite apps/sites.
Background: Dynamic animated wallpapers (live 3D space themes, minimal nature, etc.)
🧩 Extensions/Apps Store

A marketplace with cards floating in a 3D space.
Hovering a card would tilt/shine slightly.
Install apps with one click, no ugly reloads.
"Editor’s Picks" curated by an AI, updated weekly based on trends.
🌍 Tabs/Window Design

Tabs are rounded rectangles, hovering shows full live preview (mini window).
Multi-tab view: like a gallery, not messy tiny strips.
Group tabs into "Sessions" with color-coded folders.
🧠 AI Features
Built-in Assistant: Summarize articles, explain websites, find better prices automatically.

Voice Navigation: Say "Go to GitHub and open trending repos" — done.

Offline AI Mode: preloads and allows offline summarization, translation.

⚡ Performance/Usability Features
Ultra fast startup (<1 sec open from cold).

Minimal memory usage — no background garbage.

Privacy first: No tracking unless explicitly allowed. (Position against Chrome strongly.)
